# Star_Collect
 My first game made in Unity, made for a class. I initially named the game "Star Collect" when I was first working on it, but I eventually decided to change the name to "Star Bay." Below is a reflection on my work.

Before my Interactive Programming class, I had no experience with programming, and knew no coding languages. So working on this game was very much a challenge for me, though I think it is where I learned the most. Going into the creation of this game, I barely understood what a method or variables were, much less how to implement them in a script. However, I did not let this stop me. Multiple times I stayed after class to seek out clarification on the topics I was struggling with from my professor. I also attended as many open labs the GIMM program offered as I could, so that I could seek help from older peers as I worked on my game. I also utilized what I had learned from the exercises in the book The Ultimate Guide to 2D Games Development With Unity by Patrick Felicia. Though, through all of it, going to YouTube and question forms ended up being some of the resources that helped me the most.

When I first started on my game, I knew that I wanted to do a platformer. I had played platformers so I knew what they were meant to look and act like, and I had worked on one when going through Patrick Felicia’s book. I also had a general idea of a loose plot my game could follow. So while I didn’t have the skill or knowledge already available to me in how I would reach my end goal, I at least had a good idea of what I wanted my end goal to look like, which helped me immensely when it came to planning. The first thing I knew was that I wanted the game to act in a way where you had to constantly move forward, you couldn’t backtrack. My first thought was to make the camera constantly scrolling so you had to keep up with the camera’s pace in order to progress. However, I had no idea where to even start with programming something like that. So instead I looked back to what I knew how to do. I found code in Felicia’s book that would make a platform fall as soon as a player collided with it. I figured that if I could have the platform fall after a certain amount of time rather than immediately.

I had a hard time knowing what exactly to look for when searching for an answer to my issue, but eventually I figured out how to phrase my question to find the answer I was looking for. I ended up finding my solution online, when I saw that I could use the declaration Invoke to offset the time between colliding with the platform and the platform falling by a few seconds, which was perfect for what I wanted. 

Much of the rest of my project went along the same fashion. I had an idea to do something that was way out of my scope of understanding, I scaled it back to relate to something I already knew how to do, then I looked up ways to expand upon it.

My hardest challenge was when I wanted to have a game function where you could only finish a level if you had already collected a specific item, in this case, a key. I tried looking up how to accomplish this, and learned that I needed to have two scripts talk to each other, but my attempts at getting that to work were unsuccessful. I ended up coming into the GIMM lab one weekend to see if a peer mentor could help me, and thankfully, they could. They were able to explain to me the same things I had read about in the online form, but in a much more beginner friendly way. One of the peer mentors helped me start my code, though the fine tuning of it was left up to me. When I finally got the mechanic working, it was one of the best feelings in the world. Although it was a relatively small feature in the game, the hours that I poured into figuring it out didn't make it seem that way. If nothing else, that experience proved to me that if I put the time and energy into it, and made the most of my resources, I could do whatever I wanted in my game. Every minute I spent working on my game felt like an uphill battle, but the feeling of cresting that hill was worth every moment of strife. 

Eventually I ran out of time to work on my game, but I had still accomplished everything that I had initially hoped I would, and even a bit more. The experience of working on this game was invaluable to me, as it taught me how to teach myself. I did not need a step by step tutorial, instead I could go and seek out the resources that would best help me reach my goals.
